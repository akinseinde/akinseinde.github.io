                                The objective of this paper is to identify leadership attributes for effective performance of administrators of TVET institutions in Nigeria.
                                In spite of the growing research on leadership, very limited attention has been given to TVET leaders in terms of their responsibilities,
                                effectiveness and quality assurance. This study sought to identify the organizational roles and characteristics of an effective TVET leader.
                                Six research questions and six hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. A descriptive survey research was adopted and a structured
                                questionnaire was used for data collection. The population of the study was made up of all administrators in TVET institutions.
                                A sample size of 195 respondents (154 males and 41 females) was drawn using purposive sampling technique. The Leadership Attributes
                                Questionnaire (LAQ) was developed, validated and pilot-tested to establish its reliability. Data collected from administrators were analyzed.
                                It was revealed that the most important characteristics were (1) Intelligence, (2) Strong TVET curriculum background, and (3) Communication.
                                The most important organizational role is (1) Limiting class size to the number that can be instructed effectively using facilities available.
                                It is recommended that very important characteristics and organizational roles should be considered for selecting TVET administrators.

                                The Purpose of the study was to find out the adequacy of the current classroom management training program for intern teachers in Nigerian Universities. Two hundred and six respondents were used for the study. A standard questionnaire was administered to seventy males and one hundred and thirty-six females drawn from Arts, Science, Technical and Social Science programmes. Data were analysed using frequency, mean scores and analysis of variance. Major findings revealed no significant difference in classroom management competencies of male and female interns as regards leadership and discipline but there is significant gender difference in communication competencies. There is variability in classroom management competencies of intern teachers from Arts, Science, Social Science and Technical Education programmes. The intern teachers see classroom discipline as a major problem confronting them.

                                The present study examined current management strategies adopted by school administrators for
                                resolving conflict, with a view to determining the extent to which these actors agree on conflict management
                                procedures. Adopting a stratified random sampling technique, to ensure adequate national representation, 2400
                                administrators from rural and urban school districts were surveyed. Key stakeholders in the education enterprise, such
                                as teachers, principals, proprietors of schools as well as members of the school board were, in addition interviewed.
                                Clear disparity appear to exist between sampled groups, in a majority of the tested variables of avoidance, forcing, and
                                bribing, but a clustering pattern, indicating group consonance, was observed in the application of bargaining method.
                                The result highlights administrators’ preference in the use of bargaining as a conflict management tool in school
                                districts. This research has identified the preferred conflict management strategy among school administrators. In
                                addition it has thrown light on areas of dissonance, in conflict management strategy, among education managers.

                                The purpose of this study was to appraise the Curriculum of technical teacher education in terms of its compatibility to the goals of the programme. A sample of three Universities offering technical teacher programme was used for the study. Components of the technical teacher curriculum in each institution were analyzed and categorized in terms of the course units in technical specialty, general education, general studies, science and Mathematics. The results indicate that the curricula were above the minimum standard and the students' work load for graduation is high. Analyses revealed substantial technical and education components. These results have implications for addressing quality control and management in technical teacher education.

                                The study investigated why girls in secondary schools find it difficult to study Science and Technology subjects.  It determined strategies for increasing females' interest in the study of Science and Technology. Three research questions were posed and one hypothesis considered, A sample of 300 female from Girls and Mixed Schools in Government owned schools in Delta State were involved in the study. Data were collected using questionnaire.   Analysis of the data was by simple percentage, means and Z-score.   Findings from the study revealed that girls are afraid of Science and Technology subjects because of home orientation, calculations in Mathematics and Science, and low achievement in the subjects. It was found that the response of girls on strategies to adopt is not influenced by the level of their parents' education.    Implications of these findings were highlighted and recommendations made based on the findings of the study.

                                The purpose of the study was to investigate the perceptions of Vocational and Technical teachers about technological updating and the extent to which it affects different occupational fields. By using a Likert-type questionnaire, Vocational and Technical teachers or the post-secondary institutions were asked to rate students about technology which best expressed their opinion. Their responses were scored and analyzed. It was revealed that differences exist in the perception on the need to know more about the technologies of their fields.
                                The mean of occupational groups revealed that Home Economics teachers perceived the need most, and was followed by Technical Education, Fine Arts and Music teachers in that order. It was suggested that technical updating programme should be organized for Vocational and Technical teachers on a regular basis.

                                This paper described a vocationally oriented curriculum designed to provide relevant education for migrant fishermen. The presentation enters into the objectives, the curricular arrangement and the method of school organization. It seeks to give consideration to the students, the teacher and support staff, and employment/works setting.
                                Since fishing is tied to locations, ‘on-site schools’ were recommended to meet the needs of the migrants. This is considered in relation to the problem of interface with vocational education.

The questionnaire was the data gathering instrument for the study while mean and chi-square were the statistics used. Results of the analysis showed that the urban and rural groups differed significantly in the perceived mastery of five basic tasks. Also, the computed mean revealed that students in urban and rural settings were below average in seven essential tasks. It was suggested that students be made to master required job skills since graduates of radio and television servicing programme are highly needed in the job market.

                                The study sought to determine levels of student performance in basic computer skills and to identify syntax errors that are common to students in private computer training centres. One hundred and twenty-seven students from 14 computer training centres in 10 states were involved in the study. Mean, frequencies and percentages were used in analyzing the data. The result showed that the subject have high performance in basic computer operations but need some improvement in debugging programs. The most common error of the subjects is logic error. It was recommended that the development of individual programs should be emphasized.

                                The paper reviews the philosophy of science, liberal arts and technology. It presents the philosophical points in support and against the co-existence of science, liberal arts and technology education in Nigeria. At present, the system of education is biased towards science and technology as well as influenced by the philosophy of pragmatism. Since industrial and technological development can lead to economic independence, more attention is being paid to human resource production in science and engineering as well as entrepreneur development in the public and private sectors. With abundant resources, Nigeria needs scientific and technological knowledge to transfer her resources into goods and services. There is the need to nurture technology education programme so that it can grow to the desired level and status in the hands of technology educators.

                                This paper reviews the implementation of the 6-3-3-4 system with particular reference to junior and senior secondary school curriculum, workshops, equipment and tools, learning environment and conditions of service for teachers. Most of the problems identified initially as militating against the success of the educational system are still with us. These problems are traceable to economic, political and social situation in the country. The recent call for suspension of the 6-3-3-4 system of education is because the programme has failed to meet the expectations of the people. What students are learning in the present system are essentially theoretical due to lack of tools and equipment, workshop/laboratory buildings and motivated teachers. This paper recommends that we should overhaul the implementation system, reduce the content/scope of science and technical curriculum and emphasize the study of French language because of its importance and the global trend.

                            This paper examined the meaning and purpose of Technical Education and why it was integrated into the five levels of education in Nigeria.
                            The quality of education has declined because of incompetence, inadequate teaching, facilities, poor supervision and teacher quality.
                            The quality of technical education teachers should be improved in order to have competent graduates of the programme.
                            The paper analysed the relationship between the technology education system and its environment.
                            It exaplains how to improve the quality of Technical education teachers for sustainable development.
